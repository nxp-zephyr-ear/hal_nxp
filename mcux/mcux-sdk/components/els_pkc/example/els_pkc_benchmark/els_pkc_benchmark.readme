Overview
========
This benchmark is analyzing the performance of various symmetric 
and asymmetric key cryptographic algorithms. It measures performance of single 
block operations as well as opeartions using multiple blocks, whereas 
the performance is measured in cycles per block and byte and the total computation throughput in KB/s.
